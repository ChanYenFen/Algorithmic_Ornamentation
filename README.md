This is a computer-generated drawing algorithm inspired by Rafael Araujo’s meticulous geometric compositions, which he constructs using only a compass and straightedge. The algorithm pays homage to the precision and elegance of hand-drawn geometry through code.

Through noise and manipulation of the planar field, delicate strokes—like those of a light pencil—layer continuously. The uneven weight and density of lines gradually evoke a sense of three-dimensional depth. Unlike Rafael Araujo, who achieves geometric precision through countless compass-and-ruler lines, this algorithm operates with a fixed logic but ever-changing parameters, embracing controlled randomness as its drawing principle.
